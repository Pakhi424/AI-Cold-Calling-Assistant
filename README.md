# AI-Cold-Calling-Assistant

This is a personal project demonstrating how to build a conversational AI assistant for phone calls from scratch using Python. The assistant can be triggered with a voice command to make an outbound call and engage in a real-time, two-way conversation.

Project Description
This project combines several core technologies to create a full-featured AI voice assistant:

Speech-to-Text (STT): Captures spoken words and converts them into text for processing.

Text-to-Speech (TTS): Converts the assistant's text responses into natural-sounding audio.
  
Telephony API: Uses Twilio's API to manage phone calls, both outbound and inbound.

Web Server: A simple Flask server handles the conversation flow and webhook requests from Twilio.

Public Tunnel: Employs ngrok to securely expose the local server to the public internet, allowing Twilio to connect.

Project Files
assistant.py: The main script that runs locally. It listens for a "start calling" command and initiates the phone call.

app.py: The Flask server that handles the real-time, two-way conversation with the person who answers the call.

run_all.py: An optional utility script to simplify the process of running both app.py and ngrok from a single command.

Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed and set up:

Python 3.x

pip (Python package installer)

A Twilio Account: Sign up for a free trial to get a phone number, Account SID, and Auth Token.

ngrok: A tunneling tool to expose your local server. You can download it from the official ngrok website.

Installation
Install the required Python libraries by running the following command in your terminal:

pip install SpeechRecognition pyttsx3 PyAudio Flask twilio

Setup
Configure Twilio Credentials:

Open the assistant.py and app.py files.

Replace the placeholder values for account_sid, auth_token, and from_number with your actual Twilio credentials and phone number.

⚠️ IMPORTANT: Never commit your credentials to a public GitHub repository. Use environment variables for production projects.

Set up ngrok:

After installing ngrok, open your terminal and authenticate your account.

ngrok config add-authtoken YOUR_NGROK_AUTHTOKEN

Update the ngrok URL:

The ngrok_url variable in assistant.py must be updated with the public URL generated by ngrok.

How to Run the Project
You must run the Flask server and the ngrok tunnel concurrently to handle the two-way conversation.

Start the Flask Server (Terminal 1):
Open a new terminal window and run app.py to start the server.

python app.py

Start the ngrok Tunnel (Terminal 2):
Open a second terminal window and run ngrok. Copy the public URL it provides.

ngrok http 5000

Paste this URL into the ngrok_url variable in assistant.py and save the file.

Run the Assistant (Terminal 2):
In the same second terminal window, run the assistant.py script.

python "assistant.py"

When prompted by the assistant, say "start calling" to initiate the cold call.

Security Warning
For this project, we hardcoded credentials and the ngrok URL for simplicity. This is not a secure practice. Before using this code for any purpose beyond a personal project or uploading it to a public repository, you must remove the hardcoded credentials and use environment variables.
